Hello, I am Vidmantas Kabo≈°is - an Engineering Director from Vilnius, Lithuania. After graduating from Vilnius University with a degree in Software Engineering, I worked in several companies as an individual contributor building B2C and B2B products. Ruby has been the language I spent most of my professional developer career.

My leadership journey has started even before any official role at work was earned. I ran Vilnius Ruby community meetups for more than 5 years and was a part of well-known international Ruby conferences in Lithuania.

Later in my career, I played a role of a Team Lead, Engineering Manager, and Director of Engineering. With a shift to remote work, most engineering leadership experience was gained leading fully distributed remote teams.

A passion for understanding what makes engineering teams run great led me to create this blog.
