I quite often recommend leadership books: either driven by the desire to help someone, or simply asked directly. So this is a curated list of some of the most influential engineering leadership books I have read over the years. As time goes on, I'm not just extending this list indefinitely, but trying to keep it limited to a few dozen books only.

This list is still to be created! Stay tuned.
