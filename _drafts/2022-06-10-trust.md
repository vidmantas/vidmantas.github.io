Trust is the dark matter of leadership. Nothing really holds together without trust, but "gaining trust" is often used in so vague way, one could doubt what is it really about. Let's take a look at some practical ways how to create trust.

# Trust Yourself

Step 1: trust yourself. Trust radiates from the center - you - outwards. Only if you are confident with your own leadership, your team will trust you. Nobody can be inspired by a leader who second-guesses everything they do, right? Then we continue forward: exactly the same happens with the team, squad (group of teams), function, products, entire company. Trust cannot be created without getting to it at the preceding level first. I think about it like ripples in the pond, it all starts at the center. 

So the first step, always, is to get self-confidence under control. Deliver on any promises made for yourself. Acknowledge uncertainties, but then proceed with deciseveness. Put that impostor syndrome to rest. Everyone, to some extent, has it! Work it up to the level that _you_ can fully depend on _yourself_, befor proceeding further.
