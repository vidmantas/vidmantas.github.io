There's an invitation pending in your calendar. You check it out, and subconciously hold your breath. There's something called "skip-level meeting" about to happen with your manager's manager. What you're going to talk about? You don't know this person too well, if at all. Anxiety sets in. Let's survive this together.

# The Purpose

First of all, why there's a need to have such a meeting at all? Truth is, this person you're going to talk to is accountable for your hapiness and performance at work. Not directly, this is why you have your very own manager working directly with you, but if something fails, the reporting structure guarantees the issue lands on their table. At this is not an easy task - it requires not only carefully listening for the feedback from your leader, but gathering information and signals from a good variety of other sources. Including you! So the main purpose of this meeting is not to judge or decide something, but to collect feedback and other signals how you, your team, your manager, and the rest of the organization is actually doing. 

# What Should We Talk About?

Don't worry about that too much. If there's a specific topic where your input is needed AND it requires some preparation, you'll certainly be informed about that in advance. More often, your improptu opinions and thoughts are the revealing bit the manager is looking for. So relax, and let the conversation flow. If something is important, you're going to be asked about it. 

However, it doesn't mean you're in some kind of the "test" or "interview", where you just sit back and answer questions only. It's a good chance to ask anything you've been itching to know more about. Just go for it. Have an opinion on some recent development with changes in your team, or entire company, and you're not sure it reached higher levels? A perfect chance to discuss it! 

# Guaranteed Topics

Regardless of your own unique context, there are a few topics that are pretty much guaranteed to be somewhat covered: 
* How you are feeling at your job?
* What do you think about your team, and projects you work on?
* What do you like and dislike about your manager? 
* Are there any issues that keep bothering you?

You don't have to write a script to read aloud, but it won't hurt to make up your mind so you can express yourself without extra stress.

# Everything You're Going To Say Can And Will Be Used...

You know the phrase, it ends with "against you in the court". Except in this case there's no court, and certainly there shouldn't be any bias against you. It is 1-on-1 meeting, so you can expect an appropriate respect to any confidential information you're going to mention. If unsure, please ask about it in advance. But a general rule of thumb is that data points collected here are used to build a bigger picture, but not taken out and exposed directly. For me, that would be a huge, huge faux-pas, worth escalating further. So yes, please be as revealing as possible, because this call is truly confidential. If you're in a tiniest doubt, feel free to explicitly ask where your feedback and input is going to be used and how.

# Chill

So here it is - it's simply a chance to have an interesting chat with the person who's managing your manager! It is still a profesional environment, but do not sweat about it - the person across (virtual) table is doing this often, and will guide the conversation to anywhere it's important for them.

# Tips If You're Conducting One

Skip-levels are great to suplement your model of understanding how things are going across different teams and even whole departments. However, I find that quite often there is some tension what is this meeting about, especially if a person never had such kind of a call before. To make things easier, I always build at least _some_ raport first, and might not even press on my main subject on the first round. It is much more likely to hear some juicy details if there's no suspicion on what your intent is, too. I often spend time explaining what my goals are, or simply include this into the description of the meeting invitation.

Unless you hear about some terrible misconduct (exceptional cases - make sure to involve HR right away!), never expose information givers. This seriously damages your future chances to gain any truthful opinions and insights. Sometimes to the point of no return, so not worth the risk. If you need to pass on the feedback (happens quite often), make sure to first - double-check it with other people, and second - obfuscate to the point where it would be impossible to trackback who gave this feedback. If that's impossible, consider giving mentorship sessions on how things should be working on a certain aspect, and try to fix misalignment this way. There are other creative ways, but in the end we are as journalists -  never to reveal our sources.

# Going Deeper

In the end, especially in large organizations, we all might end up in having... skip-skip-level conversation. All same thoughts outlined above still apply, just keep in mind that with such a distance, the level of abstraction is already wildly different, so just keep an eye that you give enough high-level context for the person in front of you to understand what the problem is about.
